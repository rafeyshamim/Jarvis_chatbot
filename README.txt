Hey, I’m Mohd Rafey Shamim Khan.
I’m a second-year B.Tech undergraduate student at SKIT Jaipur.

This is a basic chatbot I built using the Gemini API, and you’re welcome to use this project too!
Just please give credit if possible.

Steps to Run the Chatbot:

1. Download this chatbot from GitHub.

2. After downloading, navigate to the folder where the files are located. Right-click and choose “Open in Terminal.” Make sure Python is installed on your system.

3. Run the following command in the terminal:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Open both client.py and main.py, and replace the placeholder with your own Gemini API key from your Gemini account.

Important: Do not use someone else’s API key — it’s a cyber offense.

5. If you encounter any errors, feel free to ask ChatGPT — it can help resolve most issues.

6. For any queries, feel free to contact me at: rafey1nonly@gmail.com

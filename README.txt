hey i am Mohd Rafey Shamim Khan. 
i am a BTech undergrad second year student from skit jaipur. 
This is a basic chatbot that i made using API of Gemini so you can also use this project.
just give credit to me if possible.
Here are the steps that you have to do to make this bot work.

1. download this chatbot from github.
2. after downloading go to the folder where you downloaded the file and right click and open with terminal make sure you have downloaded python.
3. run this command: pip install -r requirements.txt
4. after this go to client.py and main.py and paste your Gemini API from your accounts on Gemini.
5. make sure not to steal someone's API as it is a cyber offense.
6. if you are getting any error then please ask Chatgpt it will resolve your error.
7. for any queries please contact to me at: rafey1nonly@gmail.com
